# Introduction

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

[Rsbuild](https://rsbuild.dev/) is a high-performance build tool powered by Rspack. It provides a set of thoughtfully designed default build configs, offering an out-of-the-box development experience.

# Get started

By default, MarsCode runs the **dev** script, but you can configure it by changing the configuration in the **.vscode/launch.json**. Refer to [Visual Studio Code's doc](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging) for how to configure launch.json.
